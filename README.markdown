Textmate Emulation Actions for Coda
-----------------------------------

Textmate Emulation Actions (TEA) are some of my favorite actions from
Textmate implemented as a [Coda][1] plugin. For general information,
including download links, see the official [TEA for Coda][2] page.

If you are interested in extending or modifying the TEA for Coda plugin
for your own use, then you've come to the right place.

Extending TEA for Coda
======================

TEA for Coda is coded in [Python][3] and can be easily extended with
your own custom actions.  If you are instead interested in coding your own
plugin in Python, the TEA for Coda project can serve as an excellent
starting point.  For more information about extending or building on TEA
for Coda, please see the [wiki][4].
