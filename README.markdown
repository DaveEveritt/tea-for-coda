Text Editor Actions for Coda
----------------------------

Text Editor Actions (TEA) for Coda (formerly Textmate Emulation Applescripts)
are some of the text manipulations that I think ever editor should have,
implemented as a [Coda][1] plugin. I originally began work on TEA because
I was interested in Coda's all-in-one workflow but completely uninterested
in abandoning Textmate's excellent HTML editing capabilities.

One of the benefits of the TEA for Coda plugin versus the original
Applescripts is that you can easily extend the plugin with arbitrary actions
of your own. All you need to know is a little bit of Python.

Extending TEA for Coda
======================

TEA for Coda is coded in [Python][3] and can be easily extended with
your own custom actions.  If you are instead interested in coding your own
plugin in Python, the TEA for Coda project can serve as an excellent
starting point.  For more information about extending or building on TEA
for Coda, please see the [wiki][4].
